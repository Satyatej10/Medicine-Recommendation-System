      <h3>About This Project</h3>
      <p>Welcome to our Symptom-Based Disease Predictor, a student-built platform where technology meets healthcare to empower users with health insights.</p>

      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>As students, we envision a future where anyone can understand their health concerns using simple tools. This project started as a college assignment to harness machine learning for practical healthcare solutions, aiming to make disease prediction accessible to all.</p>

      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <p>We are a team of students passionate about data science and healthcare. With guidance from our instructors, we combined our skills in programming, machine learning, and problem-solving to create this website. This is our effort to bridge technology and well-being as part of our academic journey.</p>

      <h3>Our Goal</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to build a user-friendly platform that uses machine learning to predict diseases from symptoms. Trained on a dataset of 132 symptoms and 41 diseases, this tool provides accurate predictions and educational resources like medications and diets to help users take charge of their health.</p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>We developed a system using nine machine learning models—like Random Forest and Logistic Regression—trained on a custom dataset (training.csv). Users input symptoms, and our platform predicts potential diseases, pulling details from handwritten datasets we compiled, including descriptions, precautions, and workouts.</p>

      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>We believe understanding health shouldn’t be complicated. As students, we’ve worked hard to ensure this tool not only predicts diseases accurately but also offers clear, actionable advice. It’s our way of making a small impact on healthcare awareness.</p>

      <h3>Join Our Learning Journey</h3>
      <p>Explore this platform, test our predictor, and see what we’ve built! This project reflects our learning in machine learning and web development, and we hope it inspires others to explore technology’s role in healthcare.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting our student project, [Your Website Name]. We’re excited to share this milestone with you as we grow as future innovators!</p>
